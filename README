This script reads the contents of my iTunes library on my iMac (Snow Leopard),
reads the contents of my mobile phone connected to my iMac through mass storage,
diffs the contents and updates the mobile phone so that the content is the same.

Theoretically, Nokia already provide tools to update your phone.  The problem is
that it's painfully slow at doing it, and this script is much faster.  Well, it's
faster in my experience, anyway.  My N97 is really annoying me and will soon be
replaced by an iPhone, but until then, this script will have to do.
